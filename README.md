# LeetCode Solutions in Different Languages

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, written in different languages.  
Each solution includes comments and optimizations where applicable.  
I aim to focus on correctness first, and then explore more efficient or idiomatic solutions.

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure


Problems are organized by language and difficulty. Each file is named with its LeetCode ID and slug for easy lookup.

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Approach

I post:
- My **initial working solution**
- **Refactored or optimized versions** (if applicable)
- Notes on what I learned or how I improved the code

## üìå Notes

- All problems are solved in **Kotlin**
- I avoid posting full LeetCode prompts to respect copyright
- PRs and discussions welcome if you're learning Kotlin too!
